The city is near-completion and able to be played properly for a full round.
Multiple dungeons littered around the game area to explore and spelunk.
Replacing racial stats with statpacks completely. Now you can be a super fast orc, or a slow but strong elf.
Full adjustment of racial locks and racial lore to fit the server setting.
Complete overhaul of the Inhumen. Similar to what you know, but no longer the same.
Complete rewriting of the Pantheon. Same gist, but written without AI.
And many more..
